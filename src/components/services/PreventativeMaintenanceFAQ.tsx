const maintenanceFAQs = [
    {
        question: "What is preventative maintenance?",
        answer: "Preventative maintenance involves routine services like oil changes, tire rotations, fluid checks, and filter replacements. The goal is to keep your car running reliably and to catch small issues before they become major, expensive repairs."
    },
    {
        question: "How does preventative maintenance save me money?",
        answer: "By investing a small amount in regular upkeep, you can avoid catastrophic failures. For example, replacing a timing belt on schedule is far cheaper than repairing the major engine damage that occurs if it breaks while you're driving."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is Everything Auto the right choice for my car's maintenance?",
